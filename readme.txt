This command tells Python to execute your main.py script with the following arguments:

***Command***
python3 main.py --cities european-cities.csv --output route.txt --limit 30000 --secondary

--cities european-cities.csv: This specifies that the city coordinates are to be read from european-cities.csv.
--output route.txt: This directs the script to save the calculated route to route.txt.
--limit 30000: This sets the trip length limit to 30000 kilometers, and the program will terminate once it finds a route shorter than or equal to this limit.
--secondary: This tells the program to run the algorithm with the secondary optimality criterion.
